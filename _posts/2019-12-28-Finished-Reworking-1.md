So it is 12:04 AM. IDK how long it has been, but i think it has taken me about 6 hours to complete the 'About' and 'Resume' pages.

I created password protection for the Resume, so that only those who are worthy, are able to access my documents.

I added gifs and images to the about page, and some brief description of myself.

TODO: Will complete the project page so that my relevant coursework is available.
