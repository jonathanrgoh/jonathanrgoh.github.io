		<h2 style="color:darkblue;">Joystick Game Controller Serial Input</h2>
		<p>In this project, I created a game controller using an Arduino Nano, Joysticks, and Buttons. From there I read the data from each input sensor and translated that into a "character value" Right (r), Left (l), Up (u), Down (d), and randome values for the buttons as high or low. Next I used a python script to read data from the serial ports of the computer where the Arduino was connected. By doing this I was able to turn the character data from the serial port into actual keyboard actions. Lastly, I created a basic snake game to allow the user to test the keyboard inputs and to play the game with the joystick input device.<a href="https://github.com/jonathanrgoh/Embedded-Systems-Projects/tree/master/Serial_Input_Game_Controller" style="color:red;"> Link.</a></p>

		<h2 style="color:darkblue;">WiFi MQTT with BLE Servers/Clients </h2>
		<p>In this project, I created several Clients & Servers using an Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense, an ESP32 DevKit, and an MQTT Protocol with Ubidots. The Arduino to capture proximity/gesture data and x/y/z coordinate acceleration data. I then created a server in the Arduino IDE to post data to a peripheral via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals. Next, the ESP32's BLE functionality was utilized to capture the Arduino Sensor Data by creating a Client that was subscribed to the specified Characteristics of the Arduino. Lastly, an MQTT protocol was used to allow the ESP32 to transmit data via WiFi to a Ubidots Client webpage. The ultimate goal of this project was to become familiar with BLE and MQTT data transmission, and to capture real-time sensor data from a remote location.<a href="https://github.com/jonathanrgoh/Embedded-Systems-Projects/tree/master/UbidotsClientServer_Project" style="color:red;"> Link.</a></p>
