	<h1>Projects</h1>

		<p>Welcome to my webpage. I decided to take-on this project to learn the basics of HTML, CSS, and Jekyll when I was bored. Did I mention that I got FREE hosting through GitHub Pages!</p>
		<p>Feel free to check out my <a href="/projects" style="color:blue;">Projects...</a> or my <a href="/resume" style="color:blue;">Resume...</a> </p>
		<p>You can find the code for this website on my GitHub.</p>
